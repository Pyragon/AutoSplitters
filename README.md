# AutoSplitters

AutoSplitters I have made for speedrunning.

## Misc

I have only just entered this community. Whilst I have previous programming experience, I have very little experience with programming games. If I am doing anything wrong, or misguided, or anything. Please, let me know, and I will definitely look into it. I would love to start making different tools and such to aid speedrunners, especially on the games I personally run, and would love any fedback to help in that.

## Current Games

### [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PS1)](/HarryPotter2PS1)
