Live Split:
    ☐ Get world record
        ☐ How do people instantly change it to 'World Record by Me' after they get one? Just keep track of old record, auto change if our time is before that.
        ☐ Would reset once you reset the live split though, until it was uploaded to/verified by speedrun.com
    ☐ Ensure splits are good enough, correlate with community
    ☐ Get new logo
    ☐ Can I change the game's name? HPatCoS looks weird
    ☐ Times completed a run

Auto Splitter:
    ☐ Issues with death (If you die in a mission beyond a checkpoint, you will respawn before that checkpoint, but stage will not go down)
    ☐ isLoading
