# Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

In this directory you will find an autosplitter for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for PS1
You will also find information I have gathered to make this autosplitter, for anyone that is interested.

Any feedback is appreciated.

## Current Issues

The start timer is activated once the stage byte in memory is incremented.
This happens about .5s-1s after the 'Yes' button is pressed on the proceed menu. As I understand it, the current speedrun standard is to start the run as soon as you hit 'Yes', and therefor, this autosplitter may cause some delay.

I will try to find an alternative to this, but until then, I would love some feedback on how to proceed.
